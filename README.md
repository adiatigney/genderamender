# genderamender
for improving gender options in dropdowns

Have a gender not available via combination of list items? Please submit a pull request!

Want to use the list? Feel free to clone! 
Please keep in mind: words like "cis" and "trans" are ADJECTIVES, NOT NOUNS.
Your users should be able to pick more than one list item.
