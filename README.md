# genderamender

for improving gender options in dropdowns

## What is it? 

A JSON dict mapping words that can describe parts of genders to integers representing their status within a n-ary framework of identities.

See the simplest of use cases in action here: https://anne-decusatis.github.io/genderamender/examples/simple.html

## Please contribute!

Please add words that you feel describe you if you don't see yourself represented by a combination of existing elements. 

We also have a set of existing issues (listed at https://github.com/anne-decusatis/genderamender/issues), not all of which require code knowledge.

## Want to use the list? Feel free to clone!

Please keep in mind: words like "cis" and "trans" are adjectives, not nouns!
Your users should be able to pick more than one list item. 

## Why? 

Tech companies have historically been pretty terrible at recognizing and supporting gender diversity in their users. 
We thought that if there was a standard to point to that was easy to follow, tech companies might start to follow it. 
It's on GitHub so anyone can contribute - we don't claim to know everything about gender.
